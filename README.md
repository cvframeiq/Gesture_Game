# Helicopter Game
This is a simple 2-D game, that tracks the tip of index finger and controls the motion of helicopter accordingly. We need to  avoid the obstacles present in the path of helicopter by navigating it with the help of index finger.
Speed of helicopter increases with the increasing score.

I used of Mediapipe framework for the real-time detection of tip of the index finger.
Also I have made use of OpenCV-Python library.

As the game procceds, the background camera view turns off and an image of buildings appears to make the game bit difficult.
